// CURRENTLY WORKIG ON 
-> region based memory allocator for my 2d physic engine.
-> color full video to ascii.


UPCOMMING PROGRAMMING IDEAS
1). 2d physic engine in c (P2D) (from scratch,except gpu piplines).
2). Packet sniffer in c or python.( using kernel level library).
3). Dynamic website using (MERN) stack.(codhelp as reference).
4). qr code generator in c.(from scratch , with some Image format is allowed).
5). 3d engine project, some time in my life.
6). coogle , using cpp(implement own parser and lexer).(idea from mister Tsoding.)
7). jit compiler for brain fuck (tsoding bfjit generate x86_64 asm as an intemidiate file.)
8). build system in c (tsoding nob.h)
9). package manager for linux.
10). some em-wave transmitter and reciver.
11). boot loader(asm)
12). compiler in c or asm.
13). Run-length encoding.
14). lazy-evalution in c 
15). make a ui labrary in c with some backend, like sdl , raylib or opengl(most needed thing )

16). voxel engine in c
